            <p>
                I’m a MERN stack developer with [X] years of experience in crafting full-stack web applications.
                 My journey began with a fascination for technology, leading me to gain expertise in MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js. I hold a [Degree] in [Field] from [University], and I’ve worked on diverse projects that showcase my ability to deliver both high-quality front-end and back-end solutions.
                <br>
                When I’m not coding, you’ll find me exploring new tech trends, 
                contributing to open-source projects, or hiking.
            </p>
